_Component to integrate with a Duolingo account, providing the status of your daily streak._

### Fork Notes

This a fork of [sphanley/Duolinguist](https://github.com/sphanley/Duolinguist).

The Duolingual integration relies on reverse engineering due to there being no published API docs for Duolingo.
Adjust your expectations, it could be a little bit brittle.
[For this reason, the original author no longer supports the component](https://github.com/sphanley/Duolinguist/issues/1#issuecomment-1672419062).

This fork attempts to fix things when Duolingo's API (a moving target) changes.

## Installation (manual)

1. Using the tool of choice open the directory (folder) for your HA configuration (where you find `configuration.yaml`).
2. If you do not have a `custom_components` directory (folder) there, you need to create it.
3. In the `custom_components` directory (folder) create a new folder called `duolingual`.
4. Download _all_ the files from the `custom_components/duolingual/` directory (folder) in this repository.
5. Place the files you downloaded in the new directory (folder) you created.
6. Restart Home Assistant
7. In the HA UI go to "Configuration" -> "Integrations" click "+" and search for "Duolingual".

## Installation (HACS)

**Untested**

Apparently it's possible to [add custom repositories to HACS](https://hacs.xyz/docs/faq/custom_repositories).

Try adding this repository. If it works, let me know and I'll update this section =)

## Configuration

This integration utilizes the UI configuration flow, and no YAML configuration is needed!
